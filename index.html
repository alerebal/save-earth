            <h2>Atmospheric Pressure & Tempreature:</h2>
            <p>
                The atmospheric pressure on Mars is very thin (less than 1%) when compared to Earth and it has an
                average
                temperature of -62°C. Mars does have polar caps, minerals, and soil that could provide sources of CO2
                and
                water to thicken the atmosphere and some have suggested that there is enough carbon dioxide locked away
                in
                Mars's ice and rocks to heat the planet. Over the years a number of ideas have been proposed on how to
                access these.
            </p>
            <p>
                But in 2018, two NASA-funded scientists found that at best, the readily accessible carbon dioxide could
                only
                increase the surface temperature by less than 10°C. They came to the conclusion that processing all
                these
                sources found on Mars would also only increase the atmospheric pressure to 7%.
            </p>
            <p>
                They state, "even if enough CO2 were to be available, it would not be feasible to mobilise it; doing so
                would require processing a major fraction of the surface to release it into the atmosphere, which is
                beyond
                present-day technology".

        <div class="gravity-info">
            <h2>Low Gravity:</h2>
            <p>
                The surface gravity on Mars is 38% of that on Earth.
            <p>
            <p>
                Because life on Earth has evolved over the past three and a half billion years in an unchanging
                gravitational field. In that context, it shouldn't be a surprise that so much of our physiology appears
                to
                be defined by -- or dependent upon -- gravity.
            </p>
            <p>
                At present, it is unknown what effects long-term exposure to this amount of gravity will have on the
                human
                body. However, ongoing research into the effects of microgravity on astronauts has shown that it has a
                detrimental effect on health, which includes loss of muscle mass, bone density, organ function, and even
                eyesight.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we wanted to terraform Mars and change it's gravity, some suggest it would mean we would have to
                change
                the overall mass of the planet itself!

        <div class="magnet-info">
            <h2>Magnetic Fields:</h2>
            <p>
                Earth's molten core creates a magnetic field surrounding our planet that helps to protect the atmosphere
                from the Sun. Harmful rays from the Sun are deflected by the magnetic field, so they don't hit the
                atmosphere and damage it
            </p>
            <p>
                Billions of years ago, Mars used to have a global magnetic field, but it shut down for reasons that are
                still unknown, about 4 billion years ago, leaving the atmosphere unshielded to radiation and causing it
                to bleed over time into space.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, we can't just simply start it back up again. But one recent study shows we could create
                an artificial one.
            </p>
            <p>
                This study points out, if you want a good planetary magnetic field, what you really need is a strong
                flow of charged particles around the planet. It turns out you can create a ring of charged particles
                around Mars, thanks to its moon Phobos.
            </p>
            <p>
                Phobos is the larger of the two Martian moons, and it orbits the planet quite closely. So closely that
                it makes a trip around Mars every 8 hours. So, the team proposes using Phobos by ionizing particles from
                its surface, then accelerating them so they create a ring-shaped cloud of ions along the orbit of
                Phobos. They argue that this could create a magnetic field strong enough to protect a terraformed Mars.
