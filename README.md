## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

* In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.

* On the left hand side menu, choose Pages.

* From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main branch and then press Save.

* The next page will displlay a notice stating the site is ready to be published. 

* Refresh GitHub and the display will now state the site is published.


* Visual Studio (VS) Code & GitPod were the Integrated Development Environments used bby the team to develop this website.

### Version Control
1.	The main repository was forked by all collaborators
2.	Branch protection was added to ensure pull requests were reviewed before merging
3.	Each team member ensured their development environment was linked by using the command:  git remote -v 
4.	For each new feature, team members created a new branch: git checkout -b branch-name
5.	To ensure this branch was being tracked: git push -u origin branch-name
6.	 In order to update the project files in their own work space:  git pull upstream main this was important to limit the amount of merge conflicts a team member came across
7.	Each team member used git add . git commit and git push to add, stage and save their work to their branch. 
8.	When a team member finished a feature they made a Pull Request.  A template was used for this Pull Request so all team members information was structured the same.  This Pull Request was then checked by another member of the team.  If a merge conflict arose the team member would be notified by a comment otherwise the branch was merged.


### Cloning
To clone this repository from [GitHub](www.github.com) to a local computer to make it easier to fix merge conflicts, add or remove files, and push larger commits or contribute use the following steps:

1. On [GitHub](www.github.com), navigate to the main page of the repository.

2. Above the list of files, click Code.

3. click Use GitHub CLI, then the copy icon.

4. Open Git Bash and change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.

5. Type git clone, and then paste the URL that was copied from step 3 above.
